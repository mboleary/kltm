# Kill-List Task Manager (kltm)

This is a piece of software used to manage todo lists for a single person.

_Side-note: the name kill-list symbolizes a person "killing it", or being very productive, hence where this name comes from. This software is explicitly not meant to keep track of killing living creatures._

__This software is still in development, and so many features are not currently implemented. Stand-by for updates.__

## List of things implemented

[ ] Add and remove Tasks

[ ] Assign Tasks to Categories

[ ] Assign Priority Value

[ ] Assign Start and Due Dates

[ ] Allow User to 'backburner' a task

[ ] Allow Export and Import of tasks in queue

[ ] View Calendar of tasks in the future

[ ] View History of completed tasks

[ ] Allow user to postpone tasks

[ ] Assign Attributes to List Items

[ ] Allow tasks to be dependant on the completion of other tasks

## Implementation Details

To keep the program simple, each task will generate a JSON file in a special directory. In order for the program to read the task list, it will require reading of all tasks.

### Directories of the storage

`/` - Root directory:
  
  `_config.json` - Master Configuration JSON File for kltm. This is generated by the software.
  
  `*` - Any Task without an assigned category
  
`/*/` - Any subdirectory. Folder Name is category

  `_config.json` - Configuration File for the Category. Contains actual name.

  `*` - Files: These files represent tasks assigned to categories
